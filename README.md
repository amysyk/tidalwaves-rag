# Conversational SMS agent
A conversational agent accessible vis SMS that answers questions about the Tidalwaves swim team. The agent is powered by a RAG app based on OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4, Twilio SMS, and content from Tidalwaves' website.

## Goal
Tidalwaves board members like me are often asked questions about our programs that we don't remember answers for on the spot. With this SMS agent, board members of our non-profit organization can quickly look up details via text message.

## Key learnings
* Langchain dramatically simplifies standing up a usable RAG agent.
* Deploying the app is where the bulk of the development effort went. :)
* It takes many days to provision an SMS-enabled phone number in the United States because it's a regulated business now.
* The quality of answers is impressive. I know the answers to most of the questions I've asked myself. The RAG app produces remarkably accurate answers.
