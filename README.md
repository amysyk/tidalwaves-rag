# Conversational agent for Tidalwaves swim team
A conversational agent accessible via a web app that answers questions about the Tidalwaves swim team. The agent is powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using OpenAI's GPT-40 mini, Streamlit, and content from Tidalwaves' website.

##Goal
Tidalwaves board members frequently receive questions about our programs that they might not immediately recall. This SMS agent allows board members and other stakeholders to quickly look up program details via text message.

##Key Learnings

* Langchain, a framework for building AI applications, dramatically simplifies creating a usable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent.
* The deployment process consumed the majority of my initial development effort.
* The RAG application consistently provides accurate and reliable answers, often matching or exceeding the knowledge of board members.
